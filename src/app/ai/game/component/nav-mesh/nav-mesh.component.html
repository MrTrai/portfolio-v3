<h2>What is a Nav Mesh?</h2>
<p>
  Most classic 2D games used the Grid system where the map is divided into a 2D grid/matrix.
  Nav Mesh is a more optimized version where it produces less meshes compare to the Grid system.
  Therefore, performing pathfinding is faster on Nav Mesh than on Grid system.

<h4>Algorithm</h4>
<h4>Approach 1: Brute Force DFS</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    Find all triangles form from all the points in the network
  </li>
  <li>
    Perform DFS to find the best combination of triangles.
    <ol>
      <li>
        The goal condition is the mesh covers the whole map.
      </li>
      <li>
        We would also like to pick the mesh where we can merge more triangles and produce more polys > 3 edges.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Approach 2: Greedy</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Find all triangles from all the points in the network.</li>
  <li>Sort the triangles by area.</li>
  <li>
    Pick the largest triangle that can fit into the mesh until the whole mesh is formed.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The goal condition is the mesh covers the whole map.
      </li>
      <li>
        We would also like to pick the mesh where we can merge more triangles and produce more polys > 3 edges.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
